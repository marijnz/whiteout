Walk around
Collision reveals part of the level
Reaching certain predetermined objects reveals part of yourself
You can die in order to progress but you lose everything you revealed so far
Reaching the suicide note means finding out what's REALLY going on
If you die after you read the suicide note you lose the game
If you move to the exit after you read the suicide note you win the game
